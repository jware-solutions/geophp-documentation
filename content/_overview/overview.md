title: "GeoPHP"
---

GeoPHP is a library of geospatial functions based on GeoRust and Turf.js. It was born due to the lack of a modern geospatial library for PHP. The tools available today are not published in the Composer repositories and are not easy to use (some requires DB drivers or constructs the Geometries from complex Strings). GeoPHP offers:

- 🚀 Modern and fast: made in PHP 7 with fast algorithms
- 🥳 Friendly and simple interface: implemented with the Object Oriented Paradigm, allows its easy and fast use by the developer.
- 👨🏼‍💻 Easy access: the library is published in Composer for quick import into your projects.
- 🛠 Tested: all methods are covered by unit tests.
- 🌟 A lot of examples!
